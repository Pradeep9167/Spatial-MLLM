## Introduction

Spatial-MLLM aims to improve how machines understand and interact with spatial data. By integrating visual information with language processing, this project enhances the capabilities of existing MLLMs. This integration opens up new possibilities for applications in fields such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality.

## Features

- **Multimodal Integration**: Combines visual and textual data for better understanding.
- **Enhanced Spatial Reasoning**: Improves the model's ability to make sense of spatial relationships.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplifies interaction with the model for developers and researchers.
- **Open Source**: Encourages community contributions and collaboration.

## Installation

To get started with Spatial-MLLM, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pradeep9167/Spatial-MLLM.git
   cd Spatial-MLLM
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use pip to install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Model**:
   You can find the latest model version in the [Releases section](https://github.com/Pradeep9167/Spatial-MLLM/releases). Download the necessary files and execute them as per the instructions provided.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using Spatial-MLLM. Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python
from spatial_mllm import SpatialMLLM

# Initialize the model
model = SpatialMLLM()

# Example input
input_data = {
    "text": "Describe the location of the Eiffel Tower.",
    "image": "path_to_image.jpg"
}

# Get the output
output = model.process(input_data)
print(output)
```

This example demonstrates how to initialize the model and process a multimodal input. Adjust the input as needed for your specific application.

## Examples

### Example 1: Spatial Query

You can ask the model spatial questions based on visual data. Here‚Äôs how:

```python
query = {
    "text": "What is the distance between the two landmarks?",
    "image": "landmarks_image.jpg"
}

response = model.answer(query)
print(response)
```

### Example 2: Object Recognition

Spatial-MLLM can also help in recognizing objects in images:

```python
image_path = "scene_image.jpg"
objects = model.recognize_objects(image_path)
print(objects)
```
